# Odin Raylib Raymath
==============


So there is a better way to use these modules - via the builtins in Odin or through linalg

However these are just in case you want to follow along with the raylib examples directly.

### Install:

This is literally just a file contaning the bindings - add everything inside the:

```
foreign lib {
....
}```

To the bottom of the import inside of the Odin raylib Vendor. Or import it yourself as an extra package, its up to you!
